Set LOGGING_ENABLED = 'True' during development to see detailed logs of function calls and returns. 
This helps with debugging and understanding the flow of the program.
Set LOGGING_ENABLED = 'True' during development to see detailed logs of function calls and returns. 
This helps with debugging and understanding the flow of the program.

Set LOGGING_ENABLED = False when presenting or deploying your application to users, so they don't see the internal 
logging details. This keeps the console output clean and user-friendly.

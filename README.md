## First Code
04-08 We create the first shared code from Dom's Code
## a lot of code later hah
10-08 comments from anto's work, explaining and a general suggestion
+ I had to create a new account. I suggested not showing 10 recipes every time we try and reduce them to 2 - we could 
decide when everything is working the right number to the users, but for us to try I think this is okay,
what do you think? I change it in this version
+ First I try to compare the codes and the classes but I was getting nowhere the classes seems right
So, I try the main code before the classes and Dominique Code before the classes: 
both of them didn't show the ingredients 
Thus, I confirm it wasn't a problem of classes it was on the original code
Gladly Dominique fixed that code on api-links So I compared Dominique's code with the new main code (Eve), 
after a while trying different parts I realized that the function display_recipes was different. 
I copy the new Dominique's display_recipes function from api-links and adapted to Eve code with classes and it work!
+ Some small thing: the welcome message is after the question about the name. I voted to remove that part
I've only added it to add error handling but we would have other parts to add this.
+ I try the code without the function get_headers and it works, so I erased it
